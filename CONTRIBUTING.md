### Not all contributions have to be code

Bug reports, feature ideas, and refactoring suggestions are very welcome in the issues tab. Feel free to submit an issue for these.

### General (best case) workflow for code contributions

- Create an issue with proposed changes, identifying the problems and fixes, and/or enhancements
  - This way we know who is doing what, we minimise wasted time
- Discuss approaches in the issue
- Fork, and implement changes on a new branch in your fork
- Test the code compiles
- Test it runs on your machine
- PR when the code compiles and runs on your machine
- Automated tests (i.e. the code compiles) must pass
- Your code will be tested on windows and macOS as well
- If all is well your PR will be merged

### Post merge

- Please indicate what name (can be some social handle, including a link as well) to appear in credits
- Your code will appear in a subsequent release
